Introduction of the Project!

1.	Description:
Following database schema is designed to function as a backend storage database for a web application built to manage a library.

By storing information in a relational database, all the tasks related to daily functioning of the library can be performed easily and much more efficiently. 
Some of the benefits of using this system to store data over traditional paper registers are as follows:

1.	Updating and modifying booklist in the library is much easier and efficient
2.	Maintaining customer details and their account is easy and efficient.
3.	Calculations like due payments can be done automatically by DBMS, thus eliminating human error
4.	RDBMS provides many ways to analyze available data, 
thus helping in making more informed decisions about inventory management and other aspects of library management

This database contains 5 tables:
1.	Author
2.	Type (Genre of book)
3.	Book
4.	Customer
5.	Transaction
